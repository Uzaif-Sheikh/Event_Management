##  Quick Start Guide:
1.	Unzip the project folder to a location of your choice. If you're reading this, you've already done this, well done!
2.	Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project folder
3.	Ensure that both installation scripts are runnable on your version of Linux by entering in the following command in the root directory of the project:
> chmod +x install.sh start.sh
4.	Run install.sh in the root directory of the project with the command:
> sudo ./install.sh
5.	Run start.sh in the root directory of the project with the command:
> sudo ./start.sh
6.	Wait for it to build. Once done, you should see in the terminal window that states "Serving!" 
7.	Open an internet browser and enter in the address:
>	http://localhost:3000/

...or whatever the Serving window shows as a link.

8.	You should see the homepage of Donâ€™tBeLate pop up!
