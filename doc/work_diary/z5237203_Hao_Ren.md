# Work Diary - Hao Ren

## Week 1

This week we formed a team that had five members, and we decided to name our team as "late".

This week, I was mainly responsible for the design of the system architecture. I discussed with the team members the tools and frameworks that might be used in the development and wrote a draft of the system design.

## Week 3

During the week, I continued to refine parts of the system design and drew the corresponding diagrams. At the same time, I am also responsible for the typesetting and editing of the proposal. Also, I started coding the database interaction part.

## Week 4

This week we need to submit the Proposal on Monday and prepare the code demo A on week 5. I designed the basic structure of the database, including schema and some helper tables.

## Week 5

This week, I focused on the implementation of the database. I use the MySQL server and keep working on the design of schemas. In addition, I design the query requirements for our backend using.

## Week 6

This is a flexible week, and I keep working on the database design and implementation. All schema has been done, and queries have been packed as some Python functions. I would keep working to ensure it works excellent and is expected on our project.
